## Project Complexity Assessment

### High-Level Complexity
The project has been assessed as **MODERATE-HIGH** complexity due to:

1. **Technical Integration Complexity**:
   - Integration with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama)
   - MCP protocol implementation for tool integration
   - Database abstraction supporting both SQLite and PostgreSQL

2. **Feature Richness**:
   - Chat interface with streaming responses
   - Tool integration via MCP
   - Multiple model provider support
   - Local-first execution architecture
   - Standalone tool testing environment

3. **Architecture**:
   - Next.js App Router with mix of server and client components
   - AI provider abstraction layer
   - MCP protocol implementation
   - Database ORM integration

## Next Steps
Based on the complexity assessment, development will proceed with a VAN phase followed by a PLAN phase to establish a structured implementation approach.
