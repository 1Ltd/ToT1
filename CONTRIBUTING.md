## Releasing and Versioning

We use [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) to manage GitHub releases.

### Conventional Commit Message Required

Your pull request title and commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format.

**Examples:**

* `fix: resolve voice chat audio initialization issue`
* `feat: support multi-language UI toggle`
* `chore: update dependencies`

This helps automate changelog generation and version bumps.

### Important Notes:

* All PRs should have a **descriptive title** in the correct format
* **No manual tagging or changelog editing** is needed â€” this is handled automatically on merge
* We recommend using **squash merge** to keep the git history clean and changelog predictable
